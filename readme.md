## User Stories completed:
I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:

title url link description rating (1-5)

I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app.

All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating.

I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view.

Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list.  It also displays an Edit button and a Delete button.

I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark.

It checks for all validations in the API documentation, and I can select from a dropdown a "minimum rating" to filter the list of bookmarks, rated at or above the chosen selection.
